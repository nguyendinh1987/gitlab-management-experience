# Notes: 
- You can only backup and restore within a single version of gitlab server. For example, the backup file generated by version 12.0.0 can only be used to retore on the exact same version, as 12.0.0. If you use for different versions, something might get wrong.
- In this summary, I only backup very minimum items from configuration directory, as /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb and /etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json. You might consider to backup other files, following information in [gitlab guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/backup_restore/).
